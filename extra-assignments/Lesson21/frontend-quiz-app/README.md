### Assignment: Create a "Start Menu" Page with Dark and Light Themes

#### Objective:
Your task is to recreate the "Start Menu" page for both mobile and desktop devices. You will also add support for dark and light themes.

#### Steps to Complete the Assignment:

1. **Design Using Figma**:
    - First, you'll need to use a design tool called Figma. Go to [Figma's website](https://www.figma.com/ui-design-tool/) and register for a free account.
    - Once you’re logged in, look for the "Import" button in the top right corner.
    - Import the `frontend-quiz-app.fig` file located in your project folder. This file contains the complete design for the project, including different versions of the "Start Menu" page (light and dark themes, and mobile and desktop versions).

2. **Explore the Design**:
    - After importing the file, the design will open in Figma.
    - Explore the design by clicking on different elements. You’ll find information about font sizes, colors, margins, paddings, etc.

3. **Build the Page**:
    - Use the information from Figma to build your page in HTML and CSS.
    - Make sure your page is responsive, meaning it should look good on both mobile and desktop devices. Avoid hardcoding widths and heights.

4. **Assets**:
    - In the assets folder of your project, you will find all the fonts and images you need. Make sure to use these in your page.

5. **Dark and Light Theme Switch**:
    - Follow the comments in the `script.js` file to implement the switch between dark and light themes.
