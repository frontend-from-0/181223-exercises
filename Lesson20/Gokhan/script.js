// 1. Create a Person class with name, age, and gender properties, 
// and a greet() method that logs a greeting message to the console.
// Then create a Student class that extends the Person class and adds a major property. 
// Override the greet() method in the Student class to log a different greeting message to the console. 
// Create 2 variables, one of type Person and one of type Student and log them to console.






// 2. Create a Shape class with name and color properties, 
// and a describe() method that logs a description of the shape to the console (e.g. "This is a blue square"). 
// Then create a Square class that extends the Shape class and adds sideLength and area properties. 
// Override the describe() method in the Square class to log a description of the square to the console 
// (e.g. "This is a blue square with a side length of 5 and an area of 25").







// 3. Create a Vehicle class with make, model, and year properties, 
// and a start() method that logs a message to the console indicating that the vehicle has started. 
// Then create a Car class that extends the Vehicle class and adds a numWheels property. 
// Override the start() method in the Car class to log a different message to the console indicating that the car has started.







// 4. Create a BankAccount class with balance and interestRate properties, 
// and deposit() and withdraw() methods. Add a transactionHistory property 
// that is an array of objects representing each transaction made on the account, 
// with properties for type (either "deposit" or "withdrawal"), amount, and date 
// ({type: "withdrawal", amount: amount, date: new Date().toLocaleDateString()}). 
// Implement deposit() and withdraw() methods that add new transactions to the transactionHistory array. 
// Implement a get transactionHistory() getter method that returns a copy of the transaction history array, 
// and a get currentBalance() getter method that calculates and returns the current balance of the account based on the transaction history.
