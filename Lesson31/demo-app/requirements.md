# Requirements for Lesson32 assignment:

Complete all Typography elements that we did not do in the lesson:
  - Display
  - Heading S
  - Body M & S

Use Design System page (https://www.figma.com/design/TktY1f8F29rlne47uLzqR2/frontend-quiz-app?node-id=259-552&t=ylEJ8zbou42AX7Bm-0) in the Figma file to find informaiton about how the component should look like.

You don't need to use components yet, just create them and we will use them later in following lessons. If you want to test that the component works correctly, you can temporary add it to the App.js component as we did in the lesson.
